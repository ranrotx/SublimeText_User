# SublimeText_User
My user config folder for Sublime Text

Idea was taken from [here](https://forum.sublimetext.com/t/what-s-the-best-way-to-backup-the-st3-configuration/25494/3).

To use:

1. remove the User folder `~/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 3/Packages/User` of the fresh install
2. clone your backup (only the User folder):

    ```
    cd ~/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 3/Packages
    git clone https://github.com/ranrotx/SublimeText_User.git User
    ```

3. install [Package Control](https://packagecontrol.io/)
4. restart Sublime Text
